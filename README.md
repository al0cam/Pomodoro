![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76ab62e9-d06f-4108-9b2f-eddafdfd47c8)

Pomodoro UI is the frontend component of a web application designed to help you manage your tasks and boost your productivity using the Pomodoro Technique. Built with **Angular**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**, it offers a fast, responsive, and intuitive user experience.

## Features

* **Customizable Pomodoro Timer:** A central timer allows you to set precise intervals for focus (Pomodoro), short breaks, and long breaks. It features start, pause, and reset controls.
* **Interactive Task List:** Easily add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and estimated Pomodoro counts.
* **Completion Tracking:** Mark tasks as completed with a visual strikethrough.
* **Expandable Task Details:** Click on any task title to expand and view its full description and Pomodoro progress.
* **Responsive Design:** The UI is built using **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI** classes, ensuring it looks and functions great across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Modern Angular Architecture:** Utilizes **Angular Standalone Components** and **Signals** for a streamlined development experience and efficient reactivity.

## Technologies Used

* **Angular:** A powerful framework for building single-page applications, leveraging its modern features like Standalone Components and Signals.
* **TypeScript:** Provides static typing for improved code quality, maintainability, and developer tooling.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Its behavior (which CSS classes to generate) is entirely configured in `tailwind.config.js`.
* **DaisyUI:** A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It functions as a **Tailwind CSS plugin**, providing pre-built, styled UI components which are then generated by Tailwind based on your `tailwind.config.js`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the Pomodoro UI running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended) & **npm**
* **Angular CLI**: Install globally via `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/al0cam/Pomodoro.git](https://github.com/al0cam/Pomodoro.git)
    cd Pomodoro
    ```
    *Note: This README assumes your Angular project resides in the root of the repository. If it's in a subdirectory (e.g., `frontend/`), navigate into that directory first: `cd frontend`.*
2.  **Install npm dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will install all required Angular, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI packages.
3.  **Start the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    The Angular application will typically be available at `http://localhost:4200`. Your browser should automatically open it.

## Project Structure

The UI part of the project is organized as a standard Angular application:

* `src/app/`: Contains the main application logic and components.
    * `app.component.ts`: The root component of the application.
    * `app.component.html`: The main template for the root component.
    * `app.component.spec.ts`: Unit tests for the root component.
    * `app.config.ts`: Configuration for standalone application providers (e.g., HttpClient, Router).
    * `app.routes.ts`: Defines the application's top-level routes (if routing is implemented).
    * `interfaces/`: Directory for TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `task-item.interface.ts`).
    * `services/`: Directory for Angular services (e.g., `task-item.service.ts` for backend communication).
    * `task-item/`: Contains the `TaskItemComponent` for displaying individual tasks.

## Future Enhancements

* **Backend Integration (Full):** Connect to a backend API to persist tasks, implementing CRUD operations.
* **User Authentication:** Add login/registration features to enable personalized task lists.
* **Advanced Timer Features:** Implement customizable sound alerts, notifications, and integration with OS features.
* **Task Management Enhancements:** Add drag-and-drop reordering, task editing, due date pickers, and filtering options.
* **Settings Page:** Allow users to configure Pomodoro durations, break times, and UI preferences.
* **Analytics/Reporting:** Track productivity metrics over time.
